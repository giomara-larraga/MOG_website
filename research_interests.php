              <h2>Research Profile</h2>
              <p>Real-life decision making problems typically need to be considered from very different perspectives. In other words, the goodness of a decision to be made must be characterized with multiple perspectives. This leads to the need to optimize several conflicting objective functions simultaneously. Therefore, the focus of the research group is multiobjective optimization.
              </p>
              <p>In multiobjective settings (with continuous variables), there typically are infinitely many Pareto optimal solutions and the ultimate task of the decision maker is to determine the best, that is, the most preferred Pareto optimal solution which is to be implemented and tested in practice. However, it is very important that before the actual decision about the final solution takes place, the decision maker should gain a good understanding about the trade-offs. The final decision should be firmly grounded.
              </p>
              <p>Benefits of multiobjective optimization include that the conflicting objective functions are taken into account simultaneously leading to an overall insight of the problem. Therefore, multiobjective optimization can bring about a significant competitive advantage when compared to widely used simplistic approaches where e.g. only some primary objective is optimized and other, although important, objectives are left without a special attention or converted into constraints. In different fields of life, there is a lot of need for multiobjective treatment but not yet enough awareness about it and, thus, the group also faces the challenge of disseminating information about the potential of multiobjective optimization.
              </p>
              <p>One of the main research interests in the group is interactive multiobjective optimization. It supports the decision maker actively in finding the most preferred Pareto optimal solution by continuously involving him/her and his/her preferences in the solution process to guide the search. The continuous involvement enables the decision maker to learn about the feasibility of one's preferences and the problem/phenomenon considered as well as interdependencies between the objectives.
              </p>
              <p>In addition to interactive multiobjective optimization methods, evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods, and different hybrid methods (incorporating benefits of different types of approaches), our group shares also interest in dealing with uncertainty, solving computationally expensive or data-driven problems, supporting groups of decision makers, developing visualizations and optimization software development including, in particular, usability issues. Actually, the group is the only group actively working with implementations of interactive multiobjective optimization methods.
              </p>
              <p>We have vast international and national collaboration networks as can be seen e.g. in our list of publications. We conduct research visits and host visitors to boost collaboration. We have collaborators e.g. in Spain, UK, Sweden, Poland, Austria, Norway, USA, France, Czech Republic and the Netherlands. </p>

                <li>IOPIS - new paradigm in interactive evolutionary optimization </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The most well-known interactive method developed in the group is NIMBUS. NIMBUS is a classification-based method where the decision maker classifies objective functions to indicate the kind of changes that are desired in the current Pareto optimal solution to make it better. Several variants of the method have been published during the years and the synchronous version is currently in use.
              </p>

              <p>
                Among more recently developed interactive methods we can mention Nonconvex Pareto Navigator for computationally expensive problems. The idea is to create an approximation of the Pareto optimal set and enable the decision maker to navigate on it. On the approximation, changes of trade-offs can be seen in real-time and then any interesting solution can be projected to the real Pareto optimal set. Without the approximation, the navigation would be too slow because calculating new Pareto optimal solutions would take too much time.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, the interactive methods in the NAUTILUS family question the idea of considering only Pareto optimal solutions throughout the solution process. Instead, the methods start from the nadir point (with very poor values for all objective functions) and allow finding the most preferred solution without anchoring and the need of giving up in some objective functions. This can be useful also for group decision making situations. In different members of the NAUTILUS method family, the decision maker has different ways to specify preference information to direct the solution process. In NAUTILUS Navigator, we combine elements of navigation methods with the NAUTILUS philosophy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because many methods developed in the group are motivated by practical applications, it is important that this work is also brought close to people who in real-life face the actual problems and apply the methods. Therefore, the group has developed and is developing several different interactive tools for multiobjective optimization.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first (even internationally) widely available interactive multiobjective optimization software was WWW-NIMBUS (available at
                <a href="http://nimbus.it.jyu.fi/">http://nimbus.it.jyu.fi/</a>), an implementation of the NIMBUS method. WWW-NIMBUS is a web-based software freely available for academic teaching and research use around the world (the first version was published as early as in 1995). Based on the WWW-NIMBUS software, the group also developed a commercial optimization tool IND-NIMBUS, which is a desktop application operating on Linux and Windows platforms. IND-NIMBUS was used for many industrial applications A demo-version is available for interested parties (<a href="http://ind-nimbus.it.jyu.fi/">http://ind-nimbus.it.jyu.fi/</a>).
              </p>

              <p>
                For broader visibility and applicability, the group has switched to open source development and develops the open source software framework DESDEO (desdeo.it.jyu.fi). The methods developed are implemented in DESDEO. In method and related software development, the group is paying special attention to intuitive human-computer interaction. Because interactive methods are supposed to support learning, the way preference information is acquired from and new insight into the problem is presented to the decision maker plays a very important role in the success of the solution process. This research contains user interface and interaction design, usability research, information visualization and visual analytic environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                The group has been active in building bridges between the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) and evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) communities. Examples of hybrid method development include approaches for estimating the nadir point utilizing EMO and achievement scalarizing functions. In addition, the efficiency and accuracy of EMO methods have been improved by hybridizing scalarizing functions and local search in them. Preference information has been also incorporated in EMO methods, for example, in the form of a reference point improving efficiency and enabling concentration on interesting Pareto optimal solutions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Alongside the general theoretical and methodological development the development of so-called approximation methods has been considered. These methods aim, in a way or another at building or utilizing an approximation of the objective functions or the Pareto optimal set (e.g. metamodels, Kriging, polyhedral or tangent plane approximations). An approximation of the Pareto optimal set is especially useful if models are computationally very time-consuming to operate. Another research focus is data-driven problems where the starting point is data and a problem formulation must be prepared based on the data. This leads to decision analytics and data-enabled decision making.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another research direction is related how to tackle with uncertainty in multiobjective optimization problems, that is, how to compare solution alternatives under uncertainty and in changing environments. This research contains studies related to robustness and deep uncertainty.

              <p>
                We have considered multiobjective optimization problems in various fields of life. For example, finding the best exercise therapy modality for knee osteoarthritis patients, finding the best forest treatment option, finding best lot sizes in inventory management, finding the optimal shape in a ventilation system of a tractor cabin, finding the best design of a permanent magnet synchronous generator and finding the best composition of microalloyed steels.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examples of applications from past projects also include continuous casting of steel (optimal control of secondary cooling), headbox design for paper machines, paper machine design (paper quality), ultrasonic transducer design, chemical process design (various processes in paper production), optimization of simulated moving bed processes (separation of fructose and glucose), optimal shape design of exhaust pipe (in two-stroke engines), intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning and brachytherapy planning as well as wastewater treatment plant design and heat transfer network synthesis.
