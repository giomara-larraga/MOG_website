                    Finland)</a> funds the project DESIDES (Decision Support with Interactive
                  Advanced Data-Enabled Multiobjective Optimization Systems) in 2023-2027. In this
                  project, we develop advanced, interactive multiobjective optimization methods to
                  support making trustworthy and intelligible decisions. We also extend our focus to
                  group decision making. The methods to be developed will augment data with human
                  judgment and communicate decisions and their consequences to the people involved
                  with novel, interactive visualizations. At the same time, we extend the open-source
                  software framework DESDEO group decision making and answer the need to provide
                  explainable, data-enabled decision recommendations. We will pilot and verify our
                  approaches with selected application cases.

                  <a href="https://www.aka.fi/en/">Academy of Finland</a> funds the consortium project
                  UTOPIA (Is climate smart forestry a utopia if the preferences of landowners are not
                  considered?) in 2023-2025. The other consortium partners are Natural Resources
                  Institute Finland (PI) and University of Eastern Finland. In this project, we
                  develop methods to support stakeholders in implementing climate smart forestry,
                  which advances carbon neutrality but also considers financial objectives. Since
                  different forest owners typically have different preferences about what kind of
                  management is practiced, we focus on supporting decision making in this setting and
                  finding the most preferred solution among multiple conflicting objective functions.

                    Finland</a> funded the project <b>DAEMON</b> (Data-driven Decision
                  Support with Multiobjective Optimization) in 2019-2023. In this project, methods
                  were
                  developed for data-driven decision support. Decision analytics was augmented with
                  multiobjective optimization as multiobjective decision analytics. The results were
                  implemented in an open source software framework <a href="https://desdeo.it.jyu.fi">DESDEO</a> and are, thus,
                  applicable for researchers and society. The project considered data and decision
                  problems from selected fields of life to demonstrate the large application potential
                  of the framework developed.

                  Analytics Utilizing Causal Models and Multiobjective Optimization in 2017-2021. Even
                  though the funding from the Academy has ended, DEMO still exists. DEMO focuses on
                  explicit, concrete decision problems that can be presented with mathematical
                  formalism. Predictive analytics, statistical modelling, causal inference,
                  prescriptive analytics and multiobjective optimization are the key elements needed
                  to create a seamless chain from data to decision. We refer to this as decision
                  analytics. Thanks to method and software development, decision analytics is applied
                  to support e.g. other profiling areas of the University of Jyvaskyla, especially
                  related to education and health in dealing with their decision problems.

                  project DESDEO (Decision Support for Computationally Demanding Optimization
                  Problems) in 2015-2019. In this project, new interactive multiobjective optimization
                  methods were developed for dealing with computationally demanding problems (e.g.
                  when function evaluations are time-consuming or dimensions are high). In hybrid
                  methods developed, expertise and strengths of different fields were combined. In
                  addition. a novel, general interactive multiobjective optimization framework was
                  developed. It includes open interfaces to connect external modules to it. With this
                  project, interactive multiobjective optimization were brought closer to users and
                  awareness of its potential was increased.

                    expertise in learning systems, in particular in integrating evolution and
                    learning. Additionally, he has long experience working with the Honda Research

                    group in interactive multiobjective optimization complemented each other and
                    together we developed novel optimization methods for decision support in solving
                    complex multiobjective optimization problems by combining modern meta-heuristics
                    and machine learning techniques. The output of this project was a prototype of
